A business plan for a service business is different than a plan for other types of businesses. That's why a sample business plan for an accountant, insurance agent, self storage business, cleaning service, dry cleaning, travel agent or other service business will be so helpful. A comprehensive, unique, business plan, backed by supporting data, is the only way to achieve your ultimate goal of funding your business.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server. Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), be available to many organizations (public cloud), or a combination of both (hybrid cloud).Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.

In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. ... The cloud is also not about having a dedicated network attached storage (NAS) hardware or server in residence. Python and java are best languages to use for cloud computing.Cost. Cloud computing itself is affordable, but tuning the platform according to the company's needs can be expensive, Service Provider Reliability, Downtime. Password Security Data privacy Vendor lock-in.

The future of cloud computing will most likely represent a combination of cloud based software products and on premises compute to create a hybrid IT solution that balances the scalability and flexibility associated with cloud and the security and control of a private data center.Software engineer, software architect, and DevOps engineer are among the most in-demand jobs that require cloud skills. ... Job searches that included keywords related to the top cloud providers like "Google Cloud" or "Azure" or "AWS," increased by 223% in the past three years.

A Direct Consolidation Loan allows you to consolidate (combine) multiple federal education loans into one loan. The result is a single monthly payment instead of multiple payments. Loan consolidation can also give you access to additional loan repayment plans and forgiveness programs. A Direct Consolidation Loan has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. The fixed rate is the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of one percent. There is no cap on the interest rate of a Direct Consolidation Loan. SoFi is an online loan company that offers student loan refinancing options, mortgages and personal loans. SoFi offers some of the lowest interest rates and the best consumer experience in the market. If you're hopelessly drowning in debt, know that you can't negotiate any lower interest rates with your credit card companies or creditors, or if the math works out, a debt consolidation loan may be a good decision for you. ... If it may be a good time to strike, pay it all off, and walk away debt-free. Instead, you will owe the debt consolidation company an amount equal to the total sum of all your debts. And you will pay a monthly payment to them, which will go toward paying the principal of the loan as well as interest and fees. If you can get a low interest rate, this may be a good option. An unsecured personal loan offering the chance to borrow up to �15,000 over five years, for example, is a popular alternative to a homeowner loan. Not only does this option avoid putting your home at risk, it may also come with even lower interest rates - if you can limit your borrowing to �15,000 and qualify for the market-leading deals. Consolidation can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days; in rare cases, it may take longer. The process involves the transmission and processing of payoff statements, called Loan Verification Certificates (LVCs), which can take time. If you have multiple federal student loans and want to simplify your payments, consolidating can be a smart strategy. One way to consolidate your debt is to apply for a federal Direct Consolidation Loan. ... Often, Direct Consolidation is required in order to enroll in federal programs such as income-based repayment. Consolidation is similar to refinancing a loan. You can consolidate all, just some, or even just one of your student loans. Consolidating federal student loans may be a good strategy to lower monthly payments or to get out of default, but it is not always a good idea. Consolidation is similar to refinancing a loan. You can consolidate all, just some, or even just one of your student loans. Consolidating federal student loans may be a good strategy to lower monthly payments or to get out of default, but it is not always a good idea.
An annuity loan is a type of loan an annuity holder borrows money against the cash value of the annuity contract. This type of loan allows individuals to access their retirement funds without going through the hassle of cashing out the annuity. Withdrawing money from an annuity can be a costly move, so make sure you review your plan's rules and federal law before you do. Non-qualified annuities have been used to secure loans for years. The monetary value of a non-qualified annuity or life insurance product can be used as temporary collateral for a loan. When considering using a qualified annuity as collateral, however, make sure to consult your tax accountant. An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you make a lump sum payment or series of payments and in return obtain regular disbursements beginning either immediately or at some point in the future. The goal of annuities is to provide a steady stream of income during retirement. Typically, you face a 10% tax on any money you withdraw early. You also have to pay the ordinary income taxes, which were deferred to that point, on the withdrawn money. If you are buying or building your first home and borrowing from an annuity for the down payment, the IRS grants an exemption to the penalty tax. If the annuitant dies before the defined benefit is paid, some plans provide for the remaining benefits to be paid to a beneficiary. ... Upon death, all payments stop. However, another option is to have a joint life annuity that guarantees payment for both your lifetime and that of your beneficiary. The biggest advantages annuities offer is that they allow you to sock away a larger amount of cash and defer paying taxes. Unlike other tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, there is no annual contribution limit for an annuity.

How do I franchise my business? The primary barrier to expansion that today's entrepreneur faces is lack of capital. And franchising allows companies to expand without the risk of debt or the cost of equity. ... Franchising allows entrepreneurs to overcome many of these problems by substituting a motivated franchisee for a unit manager. How much does it cost to set up the franchise? How do you start a franchise business? How much money do you make owning a franchise? Generally, it involves the owner of a business (known as the franchisor) licensing to a third party (known as the franchisee) the right to operate a business or distribute goods and/or services using the franchisor's business name and systems (which varies depending on the franchisor) for an agreed period of time. What is the best franchise to buy? What percentage does a franchise get? All the legal documents should do is describe the business and the terms you are offering to your franchisees. The process of basing your business strategy on legal questionnaires is simply insufficient for the design, development, long-term growth, management, and financial wellbeing of your franchise system. The term "Franchise Consultant" is now more commonly used to refer to someone who helps potential franchisees open a new franchise and who helps franchisors expand their business. They typically help people at both ends of the business. How much do franchise business consultants make?
